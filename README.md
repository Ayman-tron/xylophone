## This project allowed me to learn the following:

- Incorporating open source libraries of code into my project using Flutter Packages.
- Playing sound on both iOS and Android.
- Generating repeated user interface Widgets.
- Using Dart functions that can take input arguments as well as return an output.
- Dart arrow syntax for writing one line functions.
